# Incident: 2024-11-22 20-05-00

## Summary

On November 22nd, 2024 at about 20:05 UTC, an incident commenced when latency on the pizza factory spiked from under 200ms to over 32000ms almost immediately. Within one minute, our metrics system alerted to this spike and the on-call team commenced diagnosis and remediation. The remainder of the service was unaffected, but customers purchasing pizzas during this incident experienced wait times of about half a minute. The pizza factory is maintained by a separate team, which we will be communicating with in the near future to determine the root cause of this incident and how to prevent it in the future.

We are considering this a high-severity incident because of the impact on our customers, but want to reiterate that no other part of the service was affected and all transactions during this time appear to have been recorded nominally. The incident was resolved by 20:20 and latency immediately dropped, so the impact lasted for a total of only 15 minutes.

## Detection

The incident was detected when a pizza factory latency alert was triggered in our metrics portal. Josh K, the engineer on call, was immediately alerted. He confirmed that latency on pizza creation requests had spiked significantly, suggesting a problem with the pizza factory. Time-to-detection was excellent on this incident, and our efforts will focus on maintaining the alerting and on-call infrastructure that enabled the incident to be detected so quickly. We will continue to closely monitor latency at all hours to identify similar incidents as quickly as possible.

## Impact

Users encountered this issue for 15 minutes between 20:05 and 20:20 UTC on 11/22/2024. The issue affected 100% of users that purchased a pizza during this time, but other functions such as franchise management and viewing order history were unaffected. Users that encountered the incident experienced unusually long wait times for pizza order fulfillment (>30 seconds). Due to the timing of the incident after the lunch rush, usage of the system was low and no support tickets or social media posts were submitted.

## Timeline

All times are UTC.

_Thursday, November 22, 2024_
- _03:00_ - Improvements made to Grafana logging and metrics to better identify service disruptions
- _03:15_ - Increased alerting sensitivity caused a few alerts to trigger erroneously
- _03:20_ - All alerts cleared and service was running as expected
- _20:05_ - Grafana metrics show that latency suddenly spikes to over 32000ms
- _20:08_ - When latency remains high, an alert is triggered and on-call engineers are automatically notified
- _20:08_ - The first responding engineer acknowledges the alert and begins diagnosing the issue
- _20:19_ - A misconfiguration is discovered in the JWT Pizza Factory and the owners of that service are notified
- _20:20_ - The misconfiguration is reversed and JWT Pizza Factory latency immediately drops back to normal levels
- _20:25_ - Engineers perform smoke test to confirm that the service has recovered

## Response

After receiving a notification at 20:08 UTC regarding the increased latency, Josh K came online immediately in Grafana to diagnose the issue. The engineer confirmed that the incident was a result of increased latency on the pizza factory server by reviewing the logs and metrics. During the course of investigating the logs, the engineer identified the misconfiguration in the pizza factory that was causing the latency and contacted pizza factory engineers to resolve it. The only delay to the response was the time between when the first concerning metrics were recorded and when the alert was triggered. In the future, the alert could be reconfigured to trigger immediately when latencies rise to the level they did in this incident instead of after a few minutes.

# Root cause

A misconfiguration within the pizza factory service that this service depends on caused latency to spike. Changes to configuration on all JWT Pizza services should be checked and monitored more closely to prevent future incidents.

## Resolution

Three primary actions led to the recovery of the system:

1. **Misconfiguration Identification and Reversal**: After diagnosing the issue at 20:19 UTC, the on-call engineer contacted the pizza factory service team, who promptly reversed the misconfiguration. This immediate action resolved the high latency, restoring normal performance.
2. **Smoke Testing**: At 20:25 UTC, a smoke test was performed to ensure that the service was fully operational, confirming the resolution of the issue.
3. **Monitoring and Post-Incident Analysis**: The team closely monitored the system after resolution to ensure continued stability.

In the future, reducing the time between the alert and misconfiguration discovery by fine-tuning alerts could cut time to mitigation.

## Prevention

This incident highlights the need for more careful validation of configuration changes in the services that JWT Pizza depends on.

**Proposed Prevention Measures**:
1. Introduce an automated validation process for configuration changes in the pizza factory service.
2. Implement monitoring alerts for configuration changes to detect issues earlier.
3. Establish a cross-team protocol for testing dependent services after any configuration updates.
